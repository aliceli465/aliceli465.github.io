Work one-on-one with a tutor to strengthen your Chinese language skills, learn more about Chinese culture, or even to make new friends.

## How it Works

Both learners and tutors will be interviewed in order to pair learners with a tutor that best match with their Chinese Levels. Pairs will meet with each other at least once a week, for at least an hour each time.
