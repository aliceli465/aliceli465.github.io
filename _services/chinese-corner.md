## How it Works

Meet with other CLAID members every week to discuss different real-world topics. The language table is split into beginner, intermediate, and advanced sections, so all levels of Chinese speakers are welcome! Chinese Corner provides students with the opportunity to practice language skills and broaden their cultural understanding.

## Getting Started

Chinese Corner meets every Thursday evening at 6:30 pm (CST) on Discord!

No Chinese Corner until Spring 2021! Enjoy your winter break, and happy holidays!
