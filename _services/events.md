**November 20 - November 29: A Wish for a Wish**

Make and receive small wishes from your fellow CLAIDers and help make their Thanksgiving wishes come true! You can write down your own wish(es) and the wish(es) that you can accomplish for others. Your goal is to accomplish someone else’s request, and it is encouraged that the number of wishes you fulfill for others is equivalent to the number of wishes you receive. The event will take place during the week of Thanksgiving. We hope this will spread some love and goodwill that can conclude everyone's 2020 on a better note!
