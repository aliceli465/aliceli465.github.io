**Friday, September 17th, 7:00PM CST: Mid-Autumn Festival**

Join us at **Bevier Hall, Room 132** in celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival, one of the most important Chinese festivals! Come play a round of Jeopardy while learning about the history of the festival, how it's celebrated regionally, and all the different kinds of mooncakes possible. We are selling pre-packaged mooncakes for pickup and you can [PREORDER]({% link _services/mooncake-preorder.html %}) some mooncakes to pick up at the event. The proceeds from the mooncake preorder will go to support future CLAID events! Please [RSVP]({% link _services/midautumn-rsvp.html %}) so we know who's coming.
